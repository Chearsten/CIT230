			<h1>Logo Design Process</h1>
			<p>This webpage was created to showcase my logo which I created to use on my website, and for watermarking my digital work. </p>
			<h2>Thought Process:</h2>
			<p>Most designers use their names in their watermarks or website, but my name is fairly different and harder to remember correctly. I decided I would focus on my last name. This happens to coincide with the degree/field I am going into. I had thought about using a spider web, but didn't want my design or site to have a dark, old, or dirty feel. So I went with a Spirograph type look that I first created on a mathematical website and could choose the number of points (8). 
</p>
			
			<h2>Color Choices:</h2>
			<p>I chose to use a cool color scheme with analogous colors of blues, purples, and violets. When looking at color theory, the emotions those colors reflect are stability, trust, serenity, dependability, strength, creative, imaginative, royalty, and wealth. I believe these colors will work well with the target audience I am trying to attract. 
</p>
			
			<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
			<p>My target audience are small businesses, hiring managers, and artists (music, literary, etc.). Businesses wanting assistance with branding and web presence (correlating all platforms on the web) or artists looking for graphics or web design to showcase their work.
</p>
			
			<h2>Process:</h2>
			<p>Last year I decided I needed a logo for my work. With the original thought process I created the outer loops using a mathematical website. At that time I took hours creating the Webb design in paint shop at 300 dpi using one color. When trying to recreate it in Adobe Illustrator with the pen tool this year, it took me hours and a few tutorials before I was satisfied with it. I can see the benefit of creating logos in Illustrator to avoid pixilation and improve clarity with different sizing. For the typography I chose Gabriola because it is still readable with just enough serif to give some elegance. I chose Calibri as a safe match since it is commonly used and matched well with Gabriola. 
I believe my design like a spider’s web could be associated with connecting graphic elements and online media. These platforms need to be strung together to increase gestalt and unity for small or large businesses increasing better web presence.
